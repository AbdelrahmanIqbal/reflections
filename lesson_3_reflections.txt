When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
- Collaboration
- Backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Consistency

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
- Fork is GitHub exclusive technique.
- Fork clones someone else's GitHub' repository to my GitHub
- Clone creates a copy of another repository.
- Branches replicates a local repository into the same repository. After branching, both versions are separated until merged again.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
- For backup.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
- Impossible withuot source control. It would be very complicated.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
- In a collaborative environment, it is better to request pull changes from the author rather than pushing them directly into their master repository.
